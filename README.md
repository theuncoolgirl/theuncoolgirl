### Hi there, I'm Erin

### 🚀
I am a motivated problem-solver and full stack engineer with a project management background. I am passionate about learning to build and building to learn, collaborating with others, and getting the job done while having fun doing it.

### 🎧
Currently, I am working on an app that allows users to generate playlists based off of setlists from live shows they've attended, implemented with React / Redux on the frontend, Express / PostgreSQL on the backend, and leveraging APIs from Setlist.fm and Spotify.

### 🍜
And, if I am away from the keyboard, you can usually find me behind my camera, in my roller skates, or hunting down my next bowl of ramen. 

### 🛠
Additional skills: JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, Node.js, Python, Flask, Django, SQL, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS
